# Cm-caculator
An iOS application that can calculate the gravimetric molar concentration

## Overview:

Cm Calculator is a simple iOS application developed by Ray Huang that calculates the weight molar concentration of a solution based on the mass of solute, solute molecular weight, and solvent mass. This application is written in Swift using SwiftUI framework.

## Installation:

To use Cm Calculator, simply download the app from the App Store and install it on your iOS device. This application requires iOS 14.0 or later.

## Usage:

1. Open the Cm Calculator app on your iOS device.
2. Enter the mass of solute in grams in the "溶質質量（公克）" text field.
3. Enter the molecular weight of solute in the "溶質分子量" text field.
4. Enter the mass of solvent in kilograms in the "溶劑質量（公斤）" text field.
5. The weight molar concentration of the solution will be calculated and displayed below in the form of "重量莫耳濃度：[value]".

## Features:

1. The app has a simple and user-friendly interface.
2. The app uses the SwiftUI framework, which provides a modern and efficient way to build user interfaces for iOS apps.
3. The app uses the @State property wrapper to manage the state of the input fields, making it easy to update the concentration value in real-time.
4. The app uses guard statements to handle input validation and prevent crashes.

## Version History:

Version 1.0.1: Initial release on January 1st, 2023.
